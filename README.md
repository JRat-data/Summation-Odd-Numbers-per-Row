Problem (Kata) details given on Codewars:
Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...

Calculate the row sums of this triangle from the row index (starting at index 1) e.g.:

rowSumOddNumbers(1); // 1
rowSumOddNumbers(2); // 3 + 5 = 8
